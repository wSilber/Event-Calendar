# Event Calendar

This project was completed as the final project for module 5 of CSE 330. The calendar features timed events like Apple's or Google's calendar apps which allow you to create events or reminders for a certain time and day. Groups can be categorized by types and can be moved by manually changing the date, or dragging and dropping the event into another day. Calendars are also sharable with other users.

## Creative Portion
1. Shared Events
    * Users can share events with another user
    * Only the owner of the event can edit or delete the event
    * Shared Events will be shown on both the owner's and the shared user's calendar

2. Event Groups
    * Users can group their events by color
    * Events will be drawn with the color of their choosing
    * Color can be changed

3. Drag and Drop Events
    * Users can drag and drop their events into a different day to change the date
    * Only changes the date (DOES NOT CHANGE THE TIME)
